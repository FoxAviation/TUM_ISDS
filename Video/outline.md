    * Situation: Not just a single computer, but entire set of computers to initialize, configure, update, ...
    * How would the world look like without configuration management?
        * Writing scripts
    * Motivation according to intruduction in paper
    * Pictures

        * Somebody typing on a computer (CU: keyboard, entire table with actor and computer [15 sec material])
        * On-screen footage: Writing a traditional script
        * Matrix-like numbers... (   cmatrix screen recording) [5 sec material]
        * Interview outtake for motivation [~ 3 min material]
* How does configuration management work?
    * Features according to report
    * Many animations and pictures will be needed!
    * Shoot part of the explanation at the LRZ (nice background) ?
* Conclusion and transition to presentation

# Equipment #
## Kameras ##
 Camera  | Use
---------|--------------------------
Legria HF G40 | Primary cam
Sony EOS | Static scenes, Interview: Secondary cam
GoPro    | Landscape, action, ...


## Tontechnik ##
Tontechnik steht voraussichtlich uneingeschränkt zur Verfügung und kann jederzeit abgeholt werden. Das Setup besteht aus zwei Richtmikrofonen, die an an einem Galgen befestigt werden und so ideal für Interview-Situation genutzt werden können. Außerdem habe ich ein speziell für die Aufnahme von Umgebungsgeräuschen entwickeltes Mikrofon, falMCU wir mal keine Hintergrundmusik haben. Die Aufnahme erfolgt mit einem transportablen Aufnahmegerät, dass die beiden Mikrofone in zwei seperaten Tonspuren aufnimmt.

## Licht ##
* min. 2x Tageslicht-Leuchten
* 1x warm
* Reflektor Tages-/Kunstlicht 1x1 m
* Diffusor 1x1 m
