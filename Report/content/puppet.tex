\subsection{Puppet}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Short introduction to history (maybe?)
		\item Idea: Balance between detail-hiding and required customization
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Uses a master-slave architecture
		\item Uses pull config
		\item Ressource management:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Manifests describe the node configuration
			\item Groups of ressources can be organized into classes $\Rightarrow$ i.e. config for entire application can be grouped
			\item Modules combine manifests and data to improve code organization
		\end{itemize}
		\item Server node connection via SSL works as follows:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Node sends normalized data to the Puppet master
			\item Server uses this data to compile a catalog, that specifies how the node should be configured
			\item The node reports back the successful config to the master (Visible on the Puppet Dashboard)
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
