%why recent interest for config management tools (DevOps)
%trends
%why are we looking at chef & puppet


There are many commercial configuration management tools available today as well as open source software. The three most commonly used configuration tools are CFEngine, Chef and Puppet \cite{pandey2012investigating}. CFEngine was created in 1993 as a research project and gradually transformed into a mature open source solution for configuration management\cite{Zamboni:2012:LCA:2341102}. Puppet and Chef are newer developments and both maintain active open source communities \cite{pandey2012investigating}. This is also why these two tools are subject of the report.


\subsection{Puppet}

In 2003, Reductive Labs announced an alternative to CFEngine 2, which was released in 2001 \cite{pandey2012investigating}. Written by the system administrator and owner of Reductive Labs, Luke Kanies, Puppet aims to simplify the life of system administrators and provide an Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) \cite{kanies2006puppet}. In 2005, Puppet was released unter GPL, which turned out to make using it difficult for some companies. For this reason, Reductive Labs relicensed Puppet in 2011 under the Apache license \cite{puppetcomapache}. There are two versions of Puppet available. First, Open Source Puppet, which comes with a limited set of features and no commercial support, but which is available free of charge. The paid Enterprise package on the other hand aims for handling more complex infrastructure and provides more functionality, such as reporting tools and node management \cite{puppetcomenterprise}.


%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Short introduction to history (maybe?)
%	\item Idea: Balance between detail-hiding and required customization
%\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Consists of Puppet server and Puppet agents
%	\item Server (\url{https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/4.9/architecture.html})
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item One or more servers can run the Puppet master application
%		\item 
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item Uses a master-slave architecture
%	\item Uses pull config
%	\item Ressource management:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Manifests describe the node configuration
%		\item Groups of ressources can be organized into classes $\Rightarrow$ i.e. config for entire application can be grouped
%		\item Modules combine manifests and data to improve code organization
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item Server node connection via SSL works as follows:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Node sends normalized data, called facts, to the Puppet master and requests a catalog
%		\item Communication between Server and Client via HTTPS and client-verification (SSL certificate)
%		\item Server uses this data to compile a catalog, that specifies how the node should be configured
%		\item After applying the catalog, the agent submits a report to the Puppet master: The node reports back the successful config to the master (Visible on the Puppet Dashboard)
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item Puppet can run as stand-alone architecture
%	\item Puppet language
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \textbf{Declarative} language
%		\item \textbf{Resource} can describe a single file or packet
%		\item Groups of resources can be organized as \textbf{Classes}
%		\item Files
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Files are called \textbf{Manifests}
%			\item Are named with \inlinedef{.pp}
%			\item Must use UTF-8
%			\item File example\\
%			\begin{minted}[obeytabs,gobble=4, linenos, bgcolor=white, fontsize=\tiny]{puppet}
%			case $operatingsystem {
%			centos, redhat: { $service_name = 'ntpd' }
%			debian, ubuntu: { $service_name = 'ntp' }
%			}
%			
%			package { 'ntp':
%			ensure => installed,
%			}
%			
%			service { 'ntp':
%			name      => $service_name,
%			ensure    => running,
%			enable    => true,
%			subscribe => File['ntp.conf'],
%			}
%			
%			file { 'ntp.conf':
%			path    => '/etc/ntp.conf',
%			ensure  => file,
%			require => Package['ntp'],
%			source  => "puppet:///modules/ntp/ntp.conf",
%			# This source file would be located on the Puppet master at
%			# /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/ntp/files/ntp.conf
%			}
%			\end{minted}
%			\item Advertised benefits
%			\begin{itemize}
%				\item Easy to read "Self-documenting"
%				\item consistent nodes
%				\item well-tested by large community
%			\end{itemize}
%		\end{itemize}
%	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chef}

In January 2009, Jesse Robbins, the Co founder of Opscode \cite{mittechreviewrobbins}, introduced a new systems integration framework Chef \cite{chefcomannouncement}. With the concept of providing a simple and flexible interface to define infrastructure as code, Chef quickly gained popularity.  \cite{pandey2012investigating}.
