\subsection{Support}

Apart from the technical details, there are further criteria to be considered when selecting a configuration management tool. These criteria concern the ongoing support in terms of maintenance of the tool itself, as well as available technical support when dealing with issues in one's particular setup.

\subsubsection{Documentation}

When getting in touch with a new tool, having sufficient documentation available is key for a steep learning curve. Even when the user is a already familiar with a particular tool, documentation will help by specifying the exact behavior of the tool and describe more efficient ways to achieve a desired goal. This may especially be important, if operations have unintuitive side effects or contain identified bugs.

\subsubsection{Maturity}

When software is just released, there is a high chance for it to crash or behave in an undefined way. Over time, these issues are corrected shortly after detection, so that the software gets more and more stable. When operating critical infrastructure, the maturity of software must therefore be taken into serious consideration to ensure high availability and reliability.

\subsubsection{Commercial support}

The breakdown of critical infrastructure may have a serious impact on its environment. On the other hand, having a sufficiently large team at hand to tackle any issues at all team is extremely costly. Therefore, commercial support plays a critical role in such applications. Commercial support not only allows for quick reaction to failures, but may also offer training opportunities \cite{delaet2010survey}.

\subsubsection{Community}

Apart from the official documentation, there is much more information available, mostly created and maintained by the community in the form of forums, wiki's and social networks \cite{delaet2010survey}. Not only do they provide answers to existing questions, but allow active discussions with the community and allow to learn from other users experience. Additionally, the community usually plays an important role in the life-cycle of a tool by creating extensions, reporting bugs or even offering patches. This is especially important if a particular software is open-source and therefore allows direct influence on it's development. GitHub only hosts approximately 85 million projects \cite{githubabout}.
